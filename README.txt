Info:
I was able to get most of the Java code working but was able to properly get a jsp to operate. In result I output and made a sudo function Code base in terminal using system.out and comments on when button press in the html would be called and input into the function in SongDriver.java. You can see my attempted Jsp files with a Title, login and index. 

Design Pattern:
Iterator
State
